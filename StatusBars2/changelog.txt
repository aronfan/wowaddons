3.08.00
Fixed problems introduced by WoW 8.0 changes

3.07.00
Fixed Death Knight runes

3.06.06
Removed forgotten debug prints

3.06.05
Fixed config save that I broke last time.  Fixed display of some power bars.  Removed Shadow Orbs, since that no longer appears to be a thing.

3.06.04
Fixed playsound calls
Updated TOC for 7.3

3.06.03b
Futzing with the curse packager

3.06.02b
Fixed combo points display

3.06.01b
Fixed an on-load crash for warlocks

3.06.00b
Temporary release.  Fixes on-load crashes, Death Knight runes, Mage Arcane Charges.  I have no idea what things may or may not work for the various classes and specs, as there have been so many changes.

3.05.00
Changed combo points to use unit power template, since that's how they work now.  That means the bar won't disappear when changing targets.
Simplified bar color handling.
Fixed shadow orbs often not properly updating to 5 when going shadow.

3.04.06
Updated TOC for 6.2

3.04.05
Updated TOC for 6.1
Fixed German localization showing up in the credits for English clients
Added the translations donated on the CurseForge site for Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.  Thank you!

3.04.04
Fixed "Enable Help Tooltips" setting getting reset to "checked" on log in

3.04.03
Fixed problem with the bar layout code that was causing lua errors if none of the bars in a group were set to auto-layout

3.04.02
Added more default initialization in an attempt to deal with startup lua errors that have been reported.

3.04.01
Fix to prevent corrupted save variables files from wreaking havoc if they occur.

3.04.00
Added very basic profiles.  Basically restricted to copying settings from one character to another.  Only works for group positions and those bars that are shared between the character being copied from and the character being copied to.

3.03.01
Fixed a problem where position settings for bars that were not set to auto-layout would be lost.

3.03.00
Initial setup for localization.  Some of the German localization strings entered.

3.02.00
Single tab for all bar options rather than having them split between a layout and an options tab.
Added interface to control the layout properties of the bars.
Added interface to the group tab to control the order of bars that are marked auto-layout.
Improved group behavior so that the position of a group is no longer affected by the number of bars displayed in the previous group.

3.01.02
Now all bars show in the config panel dropdown regardless of whether they are shown or not with the current spec/form.  However, only the bars available in the current spec/form are visible.
Changes to percent text and text size are now visible on the bars before you press "Accept".

3.01.01
Updated save data version
Fixed bug with help tooltip on bars not turning off immediately when the button was unchecked

3.01.00
Changed how bars are moved.  You now hold down "Alt" to move a single bar, "Ctrl" to move a whole group and "Ctrl" and "Alt" simultaneously to move all bars.
This also carries over into moving unlocked bars outside of configuration mode.  Consequently, there is now only a need for "locked" and "unlocked" states for the bars.
Bars are automatically, temporarily unlocked in config mode regardless of their in-game-play locked state.
Bars that are unlocked now retain their position through reloads and reopening the configuration interface.

3.00.05
Fixed shadow orb bar
Fixed bars staying in position when hitting escape to exit panel rather than the normal cancel behaviour of restoring the bars to their pre-config positions.
Fixed dropdown boxes getting influenced by other interfaces
Fixed revert not carrying over into the panel settings
Added more sounds

3.00.04
Fix for bar select dropdown not working

3.00.03
Changed default color for arcane missiles bar

3.00.02
Various minor fixes.  More efficient updates for Aurastack bars.  Removed sunder bar for warriors, as that is no longer a thing.  Added arcane missles bar for arcane mages.

3.00.01b
Changed non-functional "Defaults" button to a "Revert" button that reloads your pre-config-mode settings and keeps you in config mode. 

3.00.00b
Huge new configuration interface.  Added slash commands /statusbars2 and /sb2.  Optional parameter "config" opens the new configuration panel directly instead of having to go through the Blizzard Options Panel first.

2.10.04b
Fixed Hunter Frenzy stacks not enabling

2.10.03b
Just another push to try to get CurseForge to build the package

2.10.02b
Fixed bars moving around as they appear and disappear.  DOES NOT FUNCTION WITH CURRENT LIVE CLIENT

Added the ability to set different text sizes for the text on the bars.
Added the ability to set custom colors for aura stack bars and specialty bars.

2.09.00
Added the ability to set bars' opacity, either globally or individually on each bar.  Options panel restructuring.  Major improvements and bug fixes to aura filtering UI.

2.08.03
Corrected moving aura bars

2.08.02
Corrected aura bar stack displays sliding off the aura icons when global scale was applied.

2.08.01
Corrected aura bar scaling functionality.  Stack display now scales correctly with the icons.

2.08.00
Added bars for Shaman Lighting Shield and Marksman Hunter Master Marksman buffs.  Corrected Arcane charges so they only have 4 boxes on their bar now.

2.07.01
=======
TOC bump for 5.4

2.07.00
=======
Added formatting for large numbers to make them more readable using some Blizzard functions intended for that purpose.  Several options available depending on personal preference.

2.06.01
=======
Updated TOC for 5.3

2.06.00
=======
Added a filter for buffs / debuffs.  If this option is selected, the exact name of the buff or debuff that you want displayed needs to be typed into the list 
on the configuration page for the appropriate aura bar, so if a rogue wants to see his slice and dice buff, he would type that in to the list for the player auras, 
and if he wanted to see his rupture debuff on the target, he would type that into the list for the target auras.

I'm filtering on the localized name of the aura, so you need to type in the aura name in the language that your WoW client is using and it should work fine.  I haven't
been able to test this, so if anyone using a non-English client has problems with this, let me know.

2.05.01
=======
TOC updated for WoW 5.2

2.05.00
=======
Disabled tooltips on the aura bar icons.  Added option to re-enable them if desired.

2.04.03
=======
Fixed eclipse bar

2.04.02
=======
Fix for an error that was occasionally popping up in instances (not 100% certain, but it does seem to do the job)

2.04.01
=======
Fix for Warlock Shard Bar not appearing.  Lesson of the day: "Do not assume a Blizzard define is actually defining what it appears to." or "Caution when copying Blizzard code".

2.04
====
All classes and specs tested and working.
Creating only the bars your character class could actually potentially use, so you don't have config pages for 
bars that never even could be used by your class.
Tweaked some of the bar colors to be what I feel is more representative of the power they are displaying.
Config page headings are now created using pre-defined Blizzard strings (meaning they are localized?)
Made Eclipse bar the same size as the Blizzard one until I figure out how to make it bigger without it looking crappy.

2.03
====
Fixed Chi bar power type so that it works now
Refactored specialty bars so they now all share most of their code instead of being error-prone copy-and-paste jobs.
Taking bar colors from Blizzard resources instead of having local hard coded values

2.02.03
=======
Added a necessary, missed part of the fix intended in 2.02.02

2.02.02
=======
Another quick tweak to ensure the statusbar texture doesn't get drawn behind the backdrop texture.

2.02.01
=======
Quick tweak to make default bar positions properly centered.

2.02
====
Made the bar groups individually movable so you don't have to do it one bar at a time.
Added some additional event handling to make loading the addon and switching focus and pets work better.
Removed Renewing Mists bar, as it doesn't really affect the players actions, so the aura display is good enough.

2.01
====
Improved the look of the bars by making the statusbar slightly bigger and drawing it under the frame instead of on top of it.

2.00
====
Bumped TOC for 5.1

2.00.06b
========
Discrete bars not size however large they need to be on enable, completely obliviating the need to know what the maximum possible power is.
They will always size themselves to however many embers/orbs/holy power/chi the player has at a given moment. So even if Blizzard introduces something
that increases the maximum of these types of powers, the addon will continue to work correctly, it will just add another box for those that need it.
Ember bar now updates in particle increments (untested).
Cleaned up the look of discrete bars with 6+ boxes by making the edge a little thinner so the art elements don't overlap.

2.00.05b
========
Constructing discrete bars directly now rather than from a template.  This allows me to change the number of boxes for embers, holy power etc. 
if something changes that changes the number of boxes in the bar, e.g. the player changes spec or glyphs

2.00.04b
========
I was wrong about the Frenzy, changed it back and it works now.

2.00.03b
========
Integrated Frenzy and Renewing Mist in from WOW Interface version.  
Fixed some things that look wrong with Frenzy, but untested, as I have no hunter.  I'll have to try it out on PTR.

2.00.02b
========
Main Frame position added to save/load
Range checking for scale on load

2.00.01b
========
Fixed some copy/paste errors that were causing the settings to become corrupted.
Fixed and re-enabled sunder armor bar.

2.00b
=====
Imported functionality changes made to the project by 堂吉先生 on WoW Interterface (with author's permission) while retaining the original look and configurability.
